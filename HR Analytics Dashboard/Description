I have created the design and development of this beautiful dashboard in Tableau software. 
This is the HR analytics dashboard. Now I am shortly describing this dashboard.

So where is this dashboard guys used mostly? This is very much used in all the HR departments of any company. So, to like from this dashboard, 
what does the HR department do? What can we say to take insights? So, they will come to know by using this dashboard, 
like how many the headcount of the total employees right now, like the active employees and what the attrition is every month. 
So how many people are leaving every month, every year, so that from there they can calculate.
